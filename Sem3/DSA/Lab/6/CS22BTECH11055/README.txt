Question 1 :
    
    -> "gcc Q1.c" to compile;
    -> The final answer will be displayed on pressing enter;
    
    Note : To show the implementation of the perfect hsahing required by the question, the output is basicallt the keys stored in first level of the hash table. The parameters of the hash table size and constant(i.e required for the selection of first hash function) have been hard coded with arbitrary values. The code may cause a segmentation fault(very very rarely), in which case running the code again will solve the problem.
