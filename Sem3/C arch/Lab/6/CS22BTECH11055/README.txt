Cautions :

	Make sure the config and access files included in the zip file are always in the same folder as the executable;
	Make sure there are no empty lines in the config and the access files;
	Make sure each input in the access file is of the format MODE: ADDRESS;
	Make sure each input is on a new line in the config file;
	Sample config and access files have been included in the zip file for reference;
	
Directions :

	-> Enter "g++ lab.cpp" on the terminal to compile;
	-> Enter the relative path of the config file and the access file;
	-> The addresses along with their set, status(hit or miss) and tag will be displayed on the screen;
	-> At the end total hits and misses are printed for the cache;
	
Notes :
	-> All parts of the problem statement are supported by this code;
	-> Set only has meaning for direct mapped cache and set associative cache;
	-> Therefore, it has been displayed for the above settings and omitted for the fully associative setting;
